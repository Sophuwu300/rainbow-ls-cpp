  <h2>About</h2>
  <h4>The Linux ls command but it's shown as a rainbow with file sizes with indents to make it easier to read! Made in C++, It is very fast and does everything you need it to do! You can choose the directory to view, absolute or relative path! It also lists folders at the top and alphabetically sorts them.</h4>

<h2>Build and Installtion</h2>

<h3>Build</h3>
<p>Simply clone the repository or download the files. Then you can simply run <b>make build</b> in the root of the repository to build the program. If you have strip or UPX installed you can run <b>make small</b> to shrink the binary. Then simply do <b>make install</b> and <b>make clean</b> to install and clean up the build cache.</p>

<h3>Download</h3>
<p>Go to <a href="https://sophuwu.site/rls">sophuwu.site</a> and download rls. Verify the <a href="https://sophuwu.site/pgp.txt">PGP</a> signature if you like. Then simply copy the downloaded file into /usr/local/bin/</p>

<h3>Alias</h3>
<p>You can add the line <b>alias ls="rls"</b> to your ~/.bashrc to use rls like its ls. If you have any issues with rls then you can simply use <b>dir</b> as the  original ls.</p>
